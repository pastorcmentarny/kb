* Systemize and automate key operation by identify recurring tasks and cycles
* Make calm rational decisions with data
  Experiments
  You start with a hypothesis, define a baseline/benchmark to start operating from, test your hypothesis and measure the results, then see if the experiment improved over the results of the baseline.

We’ll do the same thing with our productivity experiments!
1.) Start by creating a baseline You can measure things like the percentage of your to-do list you accomplish each day. You can give yourself a score on a scale of 1-10 for your level of focus, attention, or energy. Your mood can even be an indicator of your productivity. The number of tasks you accomplish on a given day/week can be a measure as well (you just have to make sure you structure it accordingly so that each task is roughly worth the same amount of value… i.e., you wouldn’t want one task to be writing up a complete final report and another task to be checking the mail).

Note: I do not recommend tracking number of hours you work. Productivity is not about spending more time working, but rather about accomplishing more work in less time.

2.) List out some common productivity advice you want to test (your hypotheses)

Next, list out anything you’ve ever wanted to try to see if it helps you be more productive. Some things that you could test include….

    Waking up earlier
    Reducing your caffeine intake
    Using pomodoro timers
    Working with background music (like Brain.fm)
    Standing while working
    Working out in the middle of the day
    Starting the day off with your hardest task first (eating the frog)
    Tracking your time
    Only checking email at specific times of day

Start trying them—one at a time—and measure the same metrics you recorded in your baseline.

Whatever you decided to measure in your baseline, you need to now measure those things again as you start new experiments. When you test out standing while working, you need to see how that compares to your baseline. Do one change at time. :In science-speak, this is called “controlling your variables”).
4.) Analyze performance against the baseline.

Scores: Focus , Energy , mood task completed

Priority

There is no absolute priority of an issue, only a relative priority to other issues. Once you start assigning priorities from a list, anything else than “Highest” is a passive-aggressive5 way of saying “No”.



    Important/Urgent (Do)
    Important/Not Urgent (Decide) 
    Not Important/Urgent (Delegate)
    Not important/Not-Urgent (Delete)


Create a habit of disconnecting and taking one true vacation each year.
Have a hobby that gets you to disconnect. A key turning point in my burnout recovery was rediscovering the hobbies that I enjoyed doing before Buffer, like skiing, surfing, hiking, and mountain biking.

Stages of effective reading
Active learning/reading
Processing and reflecting
Repeating
Presenting
Taking action

It sounds obvious, but taking notes while reading a book is a good starting point.
ere are the questions I am asking myself and this is how I will organize my notes for each book:
Short summary — what is this book about (one major takeaway)
Why am I reading this book
Chapter reviews and Notes (this will be organized in a way so I can test myself later on)
Great quotes (something I’d like to learn by heart and use later)
Actionable items (books should be changing our actions and behaviours)
Summary (3–5 main takeaways from the book that resonate the most with me)

Create a summary of each chapter
Create bullet points and test yourself
Teach it to a child. If you can teach a concept to a child, then you’re way ahead of the game.

Have a way to put all of those into a single place and make sure every single one of them is prioritized relatively.
