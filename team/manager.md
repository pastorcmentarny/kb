# Being Manager Tricks and TRAPS

1. Seagull manager: "Seagull managers fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, and then fly out. The signs of the
   seagull manager:
    - mass emails about the critical issues, even if they are minors or there is a slight risk of the issue.
    - Late-night calls on very-very-very critical bug.
0. When the PM can't manage priorities, he looks more like the fireman – solving the issues when they rise and 100% of
   time devoted to the urgent tasks.
0. Don't assume developers are coding 8 hours a day? Take into account:
    - the holidays
    - workshops
    - some team members are shared between the several projects.
    - the newly formed team can't start working with the full productivity from day 1?
    - meetings
    - event
    - support
0. Project plans they create are the same distance from reality as the person who claims to control the weather. As long
   as we:
    - Get the work done
    - Deliver what we say
    - Keep growing our clients' businesses
0. Managers sit in meetings to help understand higher-level company objectives. They remove roadblocks so their teams
   can continue creating. 0 . #1on1 remote leaders need to set rules around how, when, and which communication tools to
   use when working in virtual teams. What's on your mind this week? The last time we spoke, you said X was a challenge
   for you. How is that going?
0. Focus On Learning, Not Just The Output ( There are numerous languages, frameworks and design patterns in the coding
   world, so don't get overwhelmed by all the options. Learning one language will expand your critical thinking and
   problem-solving skills, rewarding your cognitive abilities. Don't focus on the outcome of building a website or app,
   but instead, focus on challenging yourself in new ways. )
0. Educate them about coding paradigms and a general understanding of software architecture.
6. Focus On Fundamentals
7. Be Humble And Patient Mentoring and teaching newcomers to the program can be challenging.
9. Utilize Examples And Give Them A Project In my experience, most people learn faster with examples—ideally, an example
   that they can relate to.
10. Teach Them How To Research And Solve Their Problems. The key is to teach employees enough to solve their problems,
    not turn them into software developers overnight. Make sure they have enough to get started, help find any
    difficulties they may run into with their specific problem and help them understand how to search the Web for
    answers if they get stuck.
11. Gamify The Lessons Learning as coding can be intimidating for newcomers, so you should make it fun for them.

## Personal Goals

Say this: Over the past three quarters, I have exceeded my sales goals by X%. I know that if I were able to work
remotely one day a week I could increase that number to X because of the flexibility my remote schedule would create.
Working remotely once a week would also give me the ability to attend a professional development class in the morning,
and work in the evenings when I am more productive. What are your plans and priorities for this week? How aligned do you
feel with where the company is going? What feedback do you have for me?

# Set Up Communication Guidelines

  coding is becoming a new norm.


cycle time, pull request throughput, and defect rate.
Cycle time - Since we want to decrease our time-to-market, we want to measure how fast and how often we deliver value to our users
Pull request throughput - We can think of each pull request as a unit of work that provides value (e.g. a new feature, a bug fix, or any other codebase improvement). That's why a total count of pull requests merged (and deployed to production) can be a proxy for value delivered.
Defect rate
Of course, moving faster doesn't improve anything if it means we're shipping more defects and bugs to our customers!

Customer engineering days
A crucial component for any builder is to be in touch with their customers: interacting directly with our customers is key to gaining insights into the questions they ask, the needs they have, and the pain points that are feeling in our systems.

With customer engineering days, we have each engineering team allocating one engineer each cycle pairing with an advocate for a day answering tickets in the inbox and fixing quick wins together. This is a great opportunity for engineers to ask our customer advocates questions about our customers, features, and products, and for advocates to share their experiences and provide some great customer insights!
