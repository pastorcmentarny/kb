    * "While at home, I didn't always have a cut-off time for checking my email or Slack, so it was easy for work to

0. If you work from home only one day a week or on occasion, make it a focus and a meeting-free day. This: Working

0. This freedom also requires us to be more disciplined when it comes to working together — particularly when it comes
   to how we communicate with one another.
0. Setting up a virtual one-to-one>it should be around 25 or 50 minutes ( we seldom need to meet for exactly a standard
   hour.)g, I usually try to send a 5-minute reminder, so that the person I'm set to chat with gets a heads up and can
   wrap up their current task or call. It is even more important to get to know each other better when you do virtual
   one-to-one. "Is there anything else I can do for you?"

set up reminders to take breaks.

Be clear with your team on when you're leaving—

Create physical boundaries between you and your workspace.

Limit the number of tasks you plan to do each day. Use the Eisenhower matrix to avoid unnecessary time-wasting tasks and
know which tasks to do next. Or plan to do just 1 big thing, 3 medium things, and 5 small things per day, the 1-3-5
rule.Manage your energy, not your time.

Set up a kind of signal that lets others know when you're in focus mode. Maybe it's a do not disturb sign on your door
or when you put on your headphones.

Explain why it's important for you to avoid interruptions—that they break your concentration and make your work ten
times harder. For young kids, getting childcare is a must, unless you plan on working only when they're asleep. Train
your kids and significant other to be self-sufficient and occupy themselves. It's frustrating to be interrupted because
you're the only person who knows where the scotch tape is.

Keep consistent work hours. Simply don't answer calls during work and perhaps even invent meetings if you have to.

How to not feel isolated when working from home Include social breaks in your schedule

Try working at co-working spaces or coffee shops s

Be careful what you say. Not because you're likely to say something wrong, or bad, or whatever, but when you work in a
distributed company, you'll find that it's more often the case that people will really listen to you.

2. Anxiety is not a deadline.

Remote work is real work.

Socializing while remote:

* Video games.
* Board games. A lot of board games are available online, for free.
* Remote coffee run. Call into a Zoom meeting on your Bluetooth headset while you and your coworkers go for a
  simultaneous walk-and-talk.
* Movie night. Ever been to a movie theater? E ? Everyone starts at exactly the same time, the movie doesn't stop, then
  everyone hangs out and talks about it afterward. Novel idea, right? Skill sharing. Book club. If for some reason you
  read instead of watching TV and movies.
* Pictionary
* Calls with random coworkers make remote work better—and more productive
