The Benefits Of Taking A Sabbatical From Work

The developer:

checks the team project management tool and then attends standup where she is clear about what she has to work on.
notes that the development environment has been automatically updated with libraries matching development and production, and the CI/CD pipelines are green.
pulls down the latest code, makes an incremental code change that is quickly validated by deploying to a local environment and by running unit tests.
depends on another team’s business capabilities for her feature. She is able to find documentation and the API spec through a developer portal. She still has some queries, so she jumps into the team’s Slack room and quickly gets some help from another developer who is doing support.
focuses on her task for a few hours without any interruptions.
takes a break, gets coffee, takes a walk, plays some ping pong with colleagues.
commits the code change, which then passes through a number of automated checks before being deployed to production. Releases the change gradually to users in production, while monitoring business and operational metrics.
The developer is able to make incremental progress in a day, and goes home happy.


Organizations look for ways to measure developer productivity. The common anti-pattern is to look at lines of code, feature output or to put too much focus on trying to spot the underperforming developers. It i

If a colleague or friend no-shows you for a prearranged meeting, here are Modern Mentor's top tips for communicating about it after:
Be stern — let them know that what they did was unacceptable and it cannot happen again
Don't reschedule immediately — find a time that works in your schedule without moving anything around
If something important and unavoidable does come up, there is no excuse for not letting your colleagues know that you need to reschedule.


When you working in corporation, there is an urge to have an objective

For some people it is awesome tool to be better tool and I am happy for them but sadly I belong to this group of people who prefer approach  "give me time to learn new thing so I use it to deliver a value to the busines or have opportuinity to do a knowledge share" where it is not about being realistic and specific thing that you need agree upon and you should be measure agaist with some time boundary. It is about to learn new thing through curiosity and be more productive, smarter and being revelant in the future.
Anyway,  So what you can do ? Well... let's translate this into SMART objectives .

SMART stands for Sometimes My Ass React Terribly ... whoops... wrong acronym. It stands for Specific ,Mesurable, Agreed upon, Realistic, Time bounded.


There is a few options.

One is learning a new language or framework.

Another options is to tacle things that you wish to be better at
For example I am from Poland and I am dyslextic and with my talent to have immunity to learn it is a bit a challenging to learn new languages like English and it takes a bit longer time to learn things in general

How I would like to improve my English ?
Well, there is a few options.
In order to improve speaking it is good to do brown bag, lunch and learn or any session that force you to talk to the people even being MC of retrospective.
If you want to improve your writing, then you can  improve documentation and readme.
I want to update Readme in these projects (give names) to allow new developer to the project to start quicker by simple
I want do this in next 4 sprint.

I found as well that attending meetup and  conference seems can be converted into SMART objective





Summary

Personal development is an fundemtal element of staing revelant in the software developer everyday life. If company gives you this oppportutinty then you should take advantage. The problem is as people are unique it can be challening to fit into 'schema' . I understand you but as we are software developers we are aware of things like pattern and we need use 'Adapter Pattern' to adapt our way of improvement into something that
In this article, I  tried to provide you some example to use as framework to help you create your own awesome SMART objective. I hope, you find it useful.
