# SLACK RULES

## Channel naming

We use a basic Slack naming convention to keep things organized.

* _#team- : Where cross-functional teams discuss their work.
* _#zone- : Zones are a collection of EPD teams with common goals or areas of the product.
* _#guild- : Where a group works on an objective. The difference between a #wg and a #guild is their lifetime. Working
  groups have an end in mind and it should be bounded. Guilds have an evergreen objective.
* _#feed- : Automatically aggregating posts of various types from different bots.
* _#hobby- : Discussing non-work things, like fitness, books, games, and the like.
* _#city- : Channels for each city/region/country with multiple Zapiens.
* _#tech-: where we discuss various how-to aspects of technology.
* _#general: General company announcements and discussion.
* _#triage: The place to ask when you don't know where to go.
* _#peopleops: The place to ask HR questions.
* _#helpdesk: The place to ask internal IT questions, like help getting on the VPN or other computer problems.
* _#fun-celebrations: Celebrate fun milestones, dates, and anniversaries.
* _#fun-gratitude: A place to express appreciation.
* _#pair-buddies: Great way to get to know people around Zapier. Join this channel to get paired with a teammate for a
  30-minute Pair Buddy chat, 1x a week.
