Your original CTO has been very successful, but at this point you need someone who can get your product stable, working at scale, and with the security needed in this day and age of ever more refined hacking methods.

At the start, you need a developer, a hacker, someone who knows how to make something that proves your concept and who is skilled enough to make it work for the small user base you will hopefully build up soon.
