# UX

1. Guidance for Good Human-System Interactions according to Jakob Nielsen are:
    - Status and communication from the system should always be visible to the user and should use the user's language
      without technical gibberish. The system should always keep user information about what's going on through
      non-intrusive feedback.
    - The system guides user what to do next and what are consequences. For example. It should prevent a user from
      making mistakes or at least warn it about possible consequences of the action.
    - The system should always help the user to recover if shit happens, so If the user makes a mistake, the system
      should have an ability to emergency stop/exit from the current state. It should explain the error in plain
      language and provide a possible solution to recover.
    - The system should be designed enough flexible too for a novice user but should allow an expert user to access to
      advanced functionality.

2. Way to Measure Usability of task
    - Speed - how quickly task can be accomplished
    - Efficiency - how many mistakes are made in accomplishing the task
    - Learnability - how easy is to learn to use the system
    - Memorability - once learned, how easy is to remember how to use the system
    - User Preference - what do users like?
3. Always Use Verbs as Button Labels.
4. Good usability
    - Simple and natural dialogue.
    - Speak the user's language.
    - Minimize memory load (for example multi-step buying process instead of one enormous form).
    - User constructive error messages.
    - Support recall.
    - Make clear exists.
    - Make shortcuts.
    - Give feedback (to user about what is going on is good/back/info).
    - Prevent errors.
    - Thrive for consistency.
5. Permission strategy depends on the clarity and importance of the permission type you are requesting. Critical
   permissions should be requested up-front, while secondary permissions may be requested in-context. Explaining a
   permission in context is another well-done example — it helps gauge user interest and improve comprehension of the
   permission. Try to explain to a user the benefits they’ll receive by giving the app access. providing a background
   image that explains the permission request. Because denying permissions may prevent a feature from working as
   intended, whenever a permission is denied it should be explained to the user.A simple rule: You should provide
   feedback whenever a permission is denied.
6. A word of caution however, when you need to find language to notify your users of incorrect/incomplete data entry,
   try to avoid negative trigger words such as “wrong, invalid, and failed” instead try to use positive language like
   “please try again” or “please fill in a valid postal code.”
7. Site visitors typically absorb the information on a webpage by an initial horizontal movement, over the page’s upper
   part. This initial element forms the F’s top bar. Then, visitors usually move their eyes down the page a little bit
   before reading across in another horizontal movement that’s shorter than the initial one. This additional element
   forms the F’s lower bar. Finally, users scan the content’s left side in a vertical movement.
8. Before You Start…
    - Before you plan for a big fun customer journey plotting event, there are a few things to do. You'll need certain
      information to do the planning.
    - Buyer personas*
    - Customer demographics data**
    - Support ticket logs
    - Click maps for your website***
    - Customer satisfaction survey results
    - Frequently asked questions from social media
    - Issues raised in email communications, etc.
    - know your critical points on the map
9. In a nutshell, perceived performance is really all about understanding how the user experiences UI performance, not
   the actual performance metrics. User feedback, or some sort of response to user input, is probably the most critical
   factor to having an app that seems to perform well. A better way of handling this would be to request data in a
   background thread (so it does not lock up the UI) and present the user with some sort of visual cue that an action is
   being performed. Your UX should always immediately respond to user input in some way.
0. Use color deliberately. Reduce the color of less-important content wherever possible. Using a conservative palette in
   your design makes the color you do use more impactful and open to interactive or visual meaning—like in error
   messages (usually red) or link
   text. `There should be a minimum amount of furniture (rules, boxes, dots, and other guide rails for traveling through the typographic space) and a maximum amount of information.`
