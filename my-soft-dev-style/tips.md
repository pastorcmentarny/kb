# BEING A BETTER DEVELOPER TIPS
1.  Do Root Cause Analysis for mistakes you made. Write down a short description of the bug, the fix, and the lessons I learned. Each case should have a date, how many times it happens, symptoms, caused, fix, lesson learned. Use my blog to do that.
2.  Fundamentals - It's a lot easier to pick up new skills when you have a real command of the underlying fundamentals. For example, if you understand JavaScript deeply, you can master any new JavaScript framework in record speed. If you know Object Oriented Programming deeply, you can master new object-oriented languages quickly, too. Learning the fundamentals can increase 10x your learning efficiency.
3.  Learning time should be a part of your schedule. Set aside a specific amount of time for learning every day. It doesn't need to be much time, even 25 minutes of reading and experimentation every day adds up quickly.
4.  When you "find an answer", don't just copy and paste the code that appears to solve a problem. Understand it because brainlessly copy and paste can make you a worse programmer.
5.  Read Lots of Code. When you read, remember to ask questions: How would I have written that block of code? What did I learn? How would I improve this code? Write these answers in a blog, share code on GitHub or community medium.
6.  Learn How to Avoid Asking Questions. You learn it the "hard way", which is the way that sticks to our memory much better - we'll remember what we've learned. It's more rewarding to figure stuff out for yourself.
7.  Git merges from developing branch daily.
8.  Use UTC as the only timezone for your servers.
9.  Building context can take hours, only to be lost by a random interruption.
10. Information Security is always flashing their badges at people and making urgent demands, regardless of the consequences to the rest of the organisation, which is why we don't invite them to many meetings.
11. We begin with the first available storey in Pivotal Tracker. Let's say that it's #3275: User Can Add A Comment To a Post. First, check out a feature branch named with the story id and a short, descriptive title: git checkout -b 3275-add-commenting.  The id allows us to easily track this branch back to the story that spawned it. The title is there to give us humans a little hint as to what's in it. It's called the 30/60/90 framework, Let's break it down:
    * 30% feedback: At about a third of the way into your project, you should solicit the team for "big picture" feedback. Remember: don't do a TON of work before you start inquiring if you're on the right track. At this point you should probably have an outline, a rough sketch, or a product spec. Before you go any further, you want to solicit some early, higher-level feedback.
    * 60% feedback: Once you've gotten a decent portion of work done, it's time for 60% feedback. You should basically have a relatively fleshed out first draft ready for this stage. This is a critical phase, and arguably the longest, so make sure you get as many people in on what you're doing as possible. The next round of feedback is when the project is nearly complete.
    * 90% feedback: So now that you've gone through 2 rounds of feedback at different stages, it's time to put the final touches on everything before it goes out. This is the time to catch any last-minute tweaks. This is NOT the time to talk about "the overall direction."


## RANDOM OTHER QUOTES

1. The truth is everything is breaking all the time, everywhere, for everyone.
0. When you developing "Act locally. Think Globally."
0. Progress, not perfection.
0. We need the help of theirs because we are limited in what we can see.
0. Yesterday's software architectures do not meet today's demands.
0. Databases which don't enforce schema do not lead to schemaless systems - they mean that schema tends to be managed at the application level rather than the database level.
0. Everything takes three times longer than it should, even if you know about it and consider it. Robert C. Martin
0. The biggest problem in software dev is a misconception
0. "There is no patch for human stupidity", Kevin Mitnick
0. The smallest possible fix.
0. The best code is written thinking about the programmers that come after. ( source: https://medium.com/97-things/the-code-restorer-bfe920a18e71)
0.  Retry feature enables an application to handle transient failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource by transparently retrying a failed operation. It can improve the stability of the application.
