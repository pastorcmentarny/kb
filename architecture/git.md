# GIT

1. A Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about why code was changed, while diff tells you what.
2. git reset git revert the biggest difference between git reset and git revert is that git reset will reset the state
   of the branch to a previous state by dropping all the changes post the desired commit while git revert will reset to
   a previous state by creating new reverting commits and keep the original commits. It's recommended to use git revert
   instead of git reset in enterprise environment.
