Discipline is a way to get things done. Having routine for a morning, during work  and evening is one of the core achieve success in working from home.

let's start from definition A routine is a sequence of actions that you do repeatedly.

Kids will barge into video calls too—a lot. Remember: not everyone has a home office with a door that closes. Even if they do, kids are going to barge into rooms they're not supposed to be in. Give parents a minute to see if they can get their kids back on track; if not, offer to postpone the meeting.

Avoid frustration. Instead, say hi to the kid. It's an opportunity for them to learn a bit about their parents' work.
