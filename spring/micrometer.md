Micrometer = Think of it like SLF4J, but for metrics!

Micrometer builds in concepts of naming convention normalization, base unit of time scaling, and support for proprietary expressions of structures like histogram data that are essential to make metrics shine in each target system. Along the way, we added meter filtering as well, allowing you to exercise greater control over the instrumentation of your upstream dependencies.
