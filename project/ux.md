For instance, you could:

Make your website more scannable by using less text and adding more imagery (as humans are 90% visual creatures).
Bouncing off the point above, show examples or explanations through imagery rather than text.
Create clear and visible navigation with wording that is familiar (i.e., don't be overly imaginative with your wording as it can confuse people who are used to web standards like 'home' and 'contact'. But that also doesn't mean you should talk like you are a computer in crazy code "Error 3.106 is faulty because of PHP.zipfile corruption 27695..." You get the point :)

Make things that are clickable, look clickable [5] and things that aren't, not. For instance, make links have underlines or different states when hovered over.
Don't overcrowd your website with content. Give people a little bit of information and then offer the opportunity to learn more through subsequent clicks.[6]
And most importantly, find out your users' true needs so you don't overcrowd the website with unnecessary functions, content and clutter. Design for their desired needs and work flows only!
