# Java 16

(Only released features excluding incubators and previews)338:    Vector API (Incubator)

1. Warnings for Value-Based Classes - Designate the primitive wrapper classes as value-based and deprecate their
   constructors for removal, prompting new deprecation warnings.
0. Pattern Matching, for instanceof - Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for the instanceof operator. Pattern matching allows common logic in a program, namely the conditional extraction of components from
   objects, to be expressed more concisely and safely.
0. Records - Enhance the Java programming language with records, which are classes that act as transparent carriers for
   immutable data.
0. Other changes:
   - ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing
   - Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default
   - Packaging Tool - Provide the jpackage tool for packaging self-contained Java applications.
