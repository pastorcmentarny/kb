The aim of the var is mainly readability. 
var is NOT a keyword . it is  new predefined type (not a keyword) 

var h = true ? 1L : 3.3;


What will be the actual type of the variable h in this example? Number? The ternary operator has complex and special type coercion rules, which usually do not cause any issue because the two expressions are close to each other.
